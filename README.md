Load your 3D model easily in a Three.js scene and enjoy Showroom mode.

## Usage

Enjoy [live demo](https://sboez.github.io/3D-Models-Load/) or type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in your terminal and go to your favorite browser Firefox :wink:

## Compatible formats

**.STL .DAE .FBX .GLTF .GLB**

## Textures

Only **.GLB** can show you the model with a texture because it's a binary file who contains images. It's also possible with **.FBX**, with Blender you need to check *copy* in *Path Mode* during export.
Others need to add texture manually. But you can still change the texture path in the code, follow the procedure explained in the comments.

## Samples

My samples models are lightweight **.GLB**
