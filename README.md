Load your 3D model easily in a Three.js scene and enjoy Showroom mode.

## Usage

Enjoy [live demo](https://modelsload.web.app/) or run locally :

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sboez/3D-Models-Load.git
```

```shell
npm install
```

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Compatible formats

**.STL .DAE .FBX .GLTF .GLB**

## Textures

Only **.GLB** can show you the model with a texture because it's a binary file who contains images. It's also possible with **.FBX**, with Blender you need to check _copy_ in _Path Mode_ during export.
Others need to add texture manually. But you can still change the texture path in the code, follow the procedure explained in the comments.

## Samples

My samples models are lightweight **.GLB**
